;;; Commentary:

;; The general-purpose process handler for crush.el (TOOL-DESIGN.md
;; layer 1).  Owns interactive process sessions: PTY spawning, output
;; buffering, yield, stdin writes, and cleanup.  Model-neutral and
;; buffer-unaware: it never reads the crush buffer, the provider, or the
;; OpenAI protocol.  The `exec_command' and `write_stdin' tools in
;; `crush-tools.el' are thin wrappers over this layer.
