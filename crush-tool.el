;;; Commentary:

;; Tool-call machinery for crush.el: the `bash' tool implementation
;; (each command runs in its own `bash -c' process, no shell state),
;; the tool registry dispatching tool-call names to executers, and the
;; v1 execution policy (`crush-tool-policy yolo': tool calls run
;; without prompting).  The file is buffer- and backend-unaware: the
;; facade (crush.el) drives the tool-call loop, the hyper backend
;; announces the tool set and re-requests with tool results, and this
;; file only executes calls and formats results.  See TOOL-DESIGN.md
;; for the full design.
;;
;; Tool execution policy is yolo for v1: tool calls run without
;; prompt, matching the run backend's auto-approve behavior (`crush
;; run' is functionally `--yolo').  Future `ask' / `allowlist' values
;; arrive with a real permission policy (tracked in TODO.md).
