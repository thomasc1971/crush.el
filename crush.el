;;; Commentary:

;; crush.el is a GNU Emacs package for direct provider interaction: a
;; dedicated interactive buffer that sends structured prompts to AI
;; models over HTTP and receives streamed responses.  The provider talks
;; to the Charm Hyper gateway (https://hyper.charm.land) via streaming
;; chat completions.
;;
;; In addition to the dedicated chat buffer, any buffer selection can
;; be used as context.  The selection is formatted as a markdown fenced
;; code block with the file path and line numbers, then inserted
;; into the crush buffer where the user can add additional context
;; about what to do with it.
;;
;; See TODO.md for the full project goal and roadmap.
