;;; Commentary:

;; Local tool implementations for crush.el: the `exec_command' and
;; `write_stdin' tools (TOOL-DESIGN.md layers 2 and 3).  Both are thin
;; wrappers over the general-purpose process handler in
;; `crush-process.el': `exec_command' starts a session and yields,
;; `write_stdin' feeds input to a live session.  Results use Codex's
;; prose status convention (`Process exited with code N' / `Process
;; running with session ID N' + `Output:') so models read them
;; naturally and echo the session id back verbatim.
;;
;; The tool *protocol* (the `crush-openai-tool-call' struct, registry,
;; dispatch, arg parsing, and the execution policy) lives in
;; `crush-openai.el'; this file implements the concrete tools and
;; registers them into `crush-openai-tool-registry' at load time.

(require 'subr-x)
;;; flycheck's emacs-lisp checker byte-compiles each file in isolation,
;;; and its batch child's `load-path' excludes the package directory.
;;; Prefer `require'; fall back to loading the sibling from this file's
;;; own directory so both flycheck and package-installed loads work.
