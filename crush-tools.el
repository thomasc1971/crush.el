;; Local tool implementations for crush.el: the `bash' tool (each
;; command runs in its own `bash -c' process, no shell state), the
;; execution policy (`crush-tool-policy yolo': tool calls run without
;; prompting), and the tool limits.  The tool *protocol* (the
;; `crush-openai-tool-call' struct, registry, dispatch, arg parsing,
;; and result format) lives in `crush-openai.el'; this file implements
;; the concrete bash tool and registers it into
;; `crush-openai-tool-registry' at load time.

;;; Code:

(require 'cl-lib)
(require 'json)
;;; flycheck's emacs-lisp checker byte-compiles each file in isolation,
;;; and its batch child's `load-path' excludes the package directory.
;;; Prefer `require'; fall back to loading the sibling from this file's
;;; own directory so both flycheck and package-installed loads work.

timeout (`crush-tool-timeout'), yields an error result with a
