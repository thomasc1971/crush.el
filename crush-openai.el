;;; Commentary:

;; The reusable OpenAI chat-completions client for crush.el: request
;; composition (history + tool-request shape), streaming SSE parsing,
;; and the curl transport.  The Charm Hyper provider
;; (`crush-hyper-provider.el') uses this for its HTTP+SSE path; other
;; OpenAI-compatible providers can reuse it by supplying their own
;; config and composing requests through `crush-openai-compose-request'
;; and `crush-openai-request'.

;;; Code:

(require 'cl-lib)
(require 'json)
(require 'subr-x)
(require 'auth-source)
;;; flycheck's emacs-lisp checker byte-compiles each file in isolation,
;;; and its batch child's `load-path' excludes the package directory.
;;; Prefer `require'; fall back to loading the sibling from this file's
;;; own directory so both flycheck and package-installed loads work.
