;;; Commentary:
;;; Tool-call machinery tests: process execution via real shell commands,
;;; the tool registry, result formatting, and the tool-call struct.  The
;;; `exec_command' and `write_stdin' tools target `crush-process.el'
;;; (TOOL-DESIGN.md); these tests exercise the full exec path through
;;; that layer with real subprocesses.

;;; Code:

(require 'ert)
(require 'cl-lib)

;;; flycheck byte-compiles this file in isolation, and its batch child's
;;; `load-path' excludes the package root and test dir.  Prefer
;;; `require'; fall back to loading each dep from this file's directory
;;; or its parent (the package root) so flycheck and package loads work.
